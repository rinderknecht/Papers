The development of Web technologies has accelerated the offer of
(commercial) e-learning platforms. 
This paper is a first step toward the design and implementation of a
platform called LeVinQam whose main functionalities are (a) the provision and
management of a series of exercises and tests (authoring tools), (b) a
personalized navigation through the 
existing collection  of  exercises and tests, taking into account the
user profile (level of skills) and history, (c) the analysis of user
answers, its storing into a 
database and its mining. 
As   case studies  we have  chosen (1) the
learning of SQL, the standard database query language, and (2) formal proofs for propositional logic, to validate the 
platform functionalities  and the mining of answers.
