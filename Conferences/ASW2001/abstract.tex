Advance in network technology leads to the design of new 
protocols and services. In order to assure successful 
communication among those new products, testing and 
validation activities for conformance and interoperability 
play an important role in the development and deployment of 
them. In this paper, we introduce the \textsc{Platonis} platform, 
a platform for validating and experimentation of new 
protocols and services.  It will, in particular, focus on WAP
protocols and services but is expected to be general enough to be used 
for other protocols and services such as those of GPRS, 
UMTS, and wired networks.
