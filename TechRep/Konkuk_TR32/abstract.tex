\noindent It is more and more common to query \XML databases using the
path language \XPath or the more expressive language \XQuery. A lot of
attention has been devoted to solve efficiently the matching of
streams of \XML elements against \XPath expressions, in particular
when the relationship between the query nodes is either parent/child
or ancestor/descendant. In the latter case, the semantics of \XPath
allows two descendants to be themselves in an ancestor/descendant
relationship. In many cases, this leads to too general queries. We
propose a novel primitive operation as a stricter interpretation of
the ancestor/descendant relation that restricts the matches to the
ending nodes of paths diverging from a common node in the data. We
propose and compare several algorithms for answering this new type of
query.
%The experimental results show that one of them substantially
%improves the performance of this new type of XML query.
