\noindent When first introduced to the analysis of algorithms,
students are taught how to assess the best and worst cases, whereas
the mean and amortized costs are considered advanced topics, usually
saved for graduates. When presenting the latter, aggregate analysis is
explained first because it is the most intuitive kind of amortized
analysis, often involving enumerative combinatorics. We show how the
aggregate analysis of functional queues can be carried out accurately
and graphically, without combinatorics nor analytical tools like
asymptotics, hence making it amenable to undergraduates. Our
presentation is independent of any programming language.
