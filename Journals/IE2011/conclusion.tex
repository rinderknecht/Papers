\section{Conclusion}

The cost \(\C{}{n}\) of a series of \(n\)~queue updates, starting on
an empty queue, is tightly bounded as \(n \leqslant \C{}{n} \leqslant
(3n+1)/2\), where the lower bound happens when all updates are
enqueuings and the upper bound when the queue ends containing one
item, located at the front. As a consequence, the \emph{amortized
  cost} of one operation is~\(\C{}{n}/n\) and lies between
\(1\)~and~\(2\). The average cost of a series of \(n\)~updates is an
open problem.
