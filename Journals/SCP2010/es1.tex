\label{es1}

\subsection{Patterns and Substitutions}

Let \mlp and \mrp be meta\-lexemes corresponding respectively to the
opening and closing meta\-parentheses, whose concrete syntax is
\texttt{\%(} and \texttt{\%)}. These meta\-parentheses are inserted by
the user in order to guide matching the pattern against the parse tree
by forcing the enclosed pattern to match one
subtree. Meta\-parentheses can be present anywhere in the pattern as
long as they are properly paired. Unparsed patterns are the smallest
set \(\overline{\cal P}\) such that
\begin{itemize}

  \item \(\el \in \overline{\cal P}\);

  \item if \(l \in {\cal L}\) and \(\overline{p} \in \overline{\cal
    P}\), then \(\cons{l}{\overline{p}} \in \overline{\cal P}\);

  \item if \(x \in {\cal V}\) and \(\overline{p} \in \overline{\cal
    P}\), then \(\cons{\meta{x}}{\overline{p}} \in \overline{\cal
    P}\);

  \item if \(\overline{p}_1, \overline{p}_2 \in \overline{\cal P}\)
    and \(\overline{p}_1 \neq \el\) then \([\mlp] \cdot \overline{p}_1
    \cdot [\mrp] \cdot \overline{p}_2 \in \overline{\cal P}\). 

\end{itemize}
Given \(\overline{p}\), the first task is to check whether
\(\overline{p} \in \overline{\cal P}\). This is done by means of a
meta\-parsing function, which either fails due to
mismatched meta\-parentheses or returns the initial pattern where all
patterns enclosed in meta\-parentheses (these included) have been
replaced by a \emph{pattern tree}. These trees are not parse trees
because they contain patterns (thus the new patterns are still
unparsed with respect to the programming language syntax). Let
\(\unary{pat}\) be their unique constructor. Thus we have
\(\unary{pat} \not\in {\cal C}\). Let us define the set of
\emph{meta\-parsed patterns} \(p\) as the smallest set \({\cal P}\)
such that
\begin{itemize}

  \item \(\el \in {\cal P}\);

  \item if \(l \in {\cal L}\) and \(p \in {\cal P}\), then
    \(\cons{l}{p} \in {\cal P}\);

  \item if \(x \in {\cal V}\) and \(p \in {\cal P}\), then
    \(\cons{\meta{x}}{p} \in {\cal P}\);

  \item if \(p_1, p_2 \in {\cal P}\) and \(p_1 \neq \el\), then
    \(\cons{\pat{p_1}}{p_2} \in {\cal P}\).

\end{itemize}

Pattern \(l_1 \; \texttt{\%(} \; l_2 \; l_3 \; \texttt{\%(} \;
\texttt{\%x} \; l_4 \; \texttt{\%)} \; \texttt{\%)}\) is the
simplified form of unparsed pattern \([l_1, \!\mlp, l_2, l_3, \!\mlp,
  \meta{\!x\!}, l_4, \mrp, \mrp].\) Its meta\-parsing is shown in
Figure~\ref{es1_pattern_tree}. (Thereupon we write `pattern' instead
of `meta\-parsed pattern'.)
\begin{figure}[h]

}
\caption{Metaparsed pattern \([l_1,
  \pat{[l_2, l_3, \pat{[\meta{x}, l_4]}]}]\)\label{es1_pattern_tree}}
\end{figure}

Let us extend substitutions to cope with patterns, not just
meta\-variables, as we did about the back\-tracking algorithm in
sub\-section~\ref{x_subst_def}. Closed patterns are defined
inductively as the smallest set \(\close{\cal P}\) such that
\begin{itemize}

  \item \(\el \in \close{\cal P}\);

  \item if \(h \in {\cal H}\) and \(\close{p} \in \close{\cal P}\),
        then \(\cons{h}{\close{p}} \in \close{\cal P}\);

  \item if \(\close{p}_1, \close{p}_2 \in \close{\cal P}\) and
    \(\close{p}_1 \neq \el\), then
    \(\cons{\pat{\close{p}_1}}{\close{p}_2} \in \close{\cal P}\).

\end{itemize}
Note the absence of meta\-variables in \(\close{\cal P}\) and,
instead, the presence of trees (\(h \in {\cal H}\)). The formal
definition of substitutions can be found in
Figure~\ref{es1_subst_def}. It is clear that the result of such
substitutions is always a closed pattern.

\subsection{Closed\hyp{}Tree Inclusion}

A relationship \((\sqsubseteq)\) is needed to capture the concept of a
closed\hyp{}tree inclusion in a parse tree, just as we did about the
backtracking algorithm in sub\-section~\ref{backtracking}. The
difference here is that closed trees may contain special nodes
\textsf{pat} that distinguish them from parse trees. The formal
definition we propose is based on ordered inference rules and given in
Figure~\ref{es1_tree_matching_def}.
\begin{itemize}

  \item Rule \textsf{ONE} states that a pattern matches a tree if the
    same pattern matches the corresponding singleton forest.

  \item Rule \textsf{EMP} means: `The empty pattern always matches the
    empty forest.'

  \item Rule \textsf{EQ} specifies that if the head of the pattern and
    the forest is the same closed tree, then the pattern is included
    in the forest if the remaining pattern \(\close{p}\) is included
    in the forest \(f\).

  \item Rule \textsf{PAT} handles the case of a pattern tree: there is
    inclusion if the subtrees \(\close{p}_1\) of the pattern tree are
    included in the subtrees \(f_1\) of the forest head and if the
    remaining pattern \(\close{p}_2\) is included in the remaining
    forest \(f_2\).

  \item Rule \textsf{SUB} states that if the two heads are different
    trees (this is implicit due to partial ordering and \textsf{SUB}
    being the last), there is inclusion if the pattern is included om
    the catenation of the subtrees \(f_1\) of the tree in the forest
    and the remaining forest \(f_2\). This rule must always be
    considered last, i.e., if a derivation ends with \textsf{SUB}, the
    last conclusion has the shape \(\close{p} \sqsubseteq
    \cons{c(f_1)}{f_2}\) \emph{and it is implied that there are no
      closed patterns} \(\close{p}_1\) \emph{and} \(\close{p}_2\)
    \emph{such that} \(\close{p} = \cons{c(f_1)}{\close{p}_1}\) or
    \(\close{p} = \cons{\pat{\close{p}_1}}{\close{p}_2}\) (which would
    lead to the conclusions of \textsf{EQ} or \textsf{PAT}).

\subsection{Pattern Matching}

Compared to the informal description of the backtracking pattern
matching given in section~\ref{backtracking}, the binding and the
unparsing steps are here specialised so to exclude each other based on
the shape of the configuration at hand (this is
syntax\hyp{}direction). The critical case is when the current pattern
starts with a meta\-variable: a step may be chosen that leads to a
match failure whilst the other step would have not. We will come back
later on this point. For now, let us describe the new binding and
unparsing operations.
\begin{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Binding.} The first element of the pattern is a
    meta\-variable \(\meta{x}\) and the first tree \(t\) of the parse
    forest is not a leaf. The meta\-variable is bound to the tree,
    i.e., \(x \mapsto t\) in the following cases.
    \begin{itemize}

      \item \emph{When the parse forest is reduced to one tree.} An
        unparsing is possible if the tree root has only one subtree
        (so cutting out the root leads to another single tree), but
        programmers usually want to bind the biggest tree. This step
        is the rule \textsf{BIND}\(_3\) in
        Figure~\ref{es1_match_def}. Notice the notation
        \(\meta{x_{[c]}}\) which is a shortcut for `\(\meta{x}\) or
        \(\meta{x_{c}}\),' where \(c\) is a node
        constructor. \(\meta{x_{c}}\) means that the meta\-variable
        \(x\) must be bound to a node labeled by a constructor
        \(c\). This gives the programmer more control on the binding
        process.

      \item \emph{When the second element of the pattern and the
        second tree of the forest are the same lexeme \(l\).} Hence
        this decision is based on a lookahead of one lexeme after the
        first tree. This case corresponds to the rule
        \textsf{BIND}\(_1\) in Figure~\ref{es1_match_def}. Note that
        there is a slight optimisation here, since \(l\) is eliminated
        in the same rule (otherwise rule \textsf{ELIM} would always
        have been used after this one). The meta\-variable \(x\) can
        be typed so it can only bind nodes of kind \(c\), which is
        denoted by \(\meta{x_{[c]}}\).

      \item \emph{When the second tree of the forest is not a leaf.}
        This is the rule \textsf{BIND}\(_2\) in
        Figure~\ref{es1_match_def}. Same remark about
        \(\meta{x_{[c]}}\).

    \end{itemize}
    The substitution \(\sigma\) resulting from the recursive call
    (among the premises) must be compatible with the binding \(x
    \mapsto c(f_1)\), i.e., \(\sigma \subseteq \sigma \oplus x \mapsto
    c(f_1)\).

  \item \textbf{Unparsing.} The root of the first tree in the parse
  forest is cut out and the tree is replaced by its direct
  subtrees.
    \begin{itemize}

      \item If the first element of the pattern is a tree pattern,
      i.e., corresponds to a meta\-parenthesis in the original
      unparsed pattern, then this tree pattern is matched against the
      first tree and the remaining pattern is matched against the
      remaining forest. The two resulting substitutions, \(\sigma_1\)
      and \(\sigma_2\), must be compatible, i.e., no binding in one is
      present in the other with the same meta\-variable, unless the
      tree is the same (in short: \(\sigma_1 \subseteq \sigma_1 \oplus
      \sigma_2\)). This is rule \textsf{UNPAR}\(_1\) in
      Figure~\ref{es1_match_def}.

}

\end{figure}

      \item Otherwise, the new configuration is rewritten. This is
      rule \textsf{UNPAR}\(_2\) in Figure~\ref{es1_match_def}, which
      must be considered last, because its conclusion can overlap with
      the one of \textsf{BIND} rules or \textsf{UNPAR}\(_1\).

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}


\begin{figure}
\VerbatimInput[frame=single]{es1.ml}
\caption{Implementation of \textit{ES}(1) in \OCaml\label{es1_match_ocaml}}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{es1_match_ocaml} shows the implementation of \text{ES}(1)
in \OCaml, a functional language with static typing. The substitutions
are lists of bindings. We use an exception instead of an empty list to
signal a match failure. The library function \texttt{List.fold\_left}
is a functional iterator such that \texttt{List.fold\_left f a [b1;
    ...; bn]} is \texttt{f (... (f (f a b1) b2) ...) bn}. The untyped
meta\-variable \(\meta{x}\) is implemented as \texttt{`Meta(x,None)};
the typed meta\-variable \(\meta{x_{c}}\) is implemented as
\texttt{`Meta(x,Some c)}; lexeme \(l\) by \texttt{`Lex(l)}; a
meta\-parsed pattern \(\pat{p}\) by \texttt{`Pat(p)}; the
non\hyp{}leaf tree \(c(f)\) by \texttt{`Node(c,f)}; a forest \(f\) by
a list of trees. The binary operator \texttt{@} is the list
concatenation; the expression \(\cons{a}{l}\) is implemented by
\texttt{a::l} and the binder `\texttt{as}' allows creating an alias in
the \OCaml pattern. The function \texttt{add} is the equivalent of the
\Prolog predicate \texttt{add/3} in Figure~\ref{x_match_def}.

\subsection{Termination and Worst\hyp{}Case Complexity}

The system terminates because each rule either strictly decreases the
number of elements in the pattern or the number of nodes in the parse
forest. A successful run happens when a configuration cannot be
rewritten furthermore and it contains an empty pattern and an empty
parse forest. Let us assume that the cost of applying an inference
rule is constant. Then the cost of a run is upper bounded by a
constant times the number of rules in the proof tree (which can be
considered as a trace of the execution). The worst\hyp{}case
complexity is thus obtained by an initial configuration which leads to
the maximum number of rules being used. The observation made about the
termination of the system gives us the clue as how to proceed in
finding such input. Because a meta\-variable cannot be bound to a
lexeme (i.e., a tree leaf), the nodes of the bounded subtree are not
considered by the algorithm. Thus, the worst case contains no
meta\-variables, so no \textsf{BIND} rule is used. Moreover, the size
of the pattern has no impact on the cost, since a meta\-parenthesis or
a lexeme are eliminated at the same time a node or a leaf is removed
from the parse forest (see rules \textsf{ELIM} and
\textsf{UNPAR}\(_1\)). The worst\hyp{}case complexity follows: it is
linear in the number of nodes in the parse forest.

\subsection{Soundness}
\input{es1_soundness}

\subsection{Completeness}

This algorithm is not complete in the sense the backtracking algorithm
was in section~\ref{backtracking:completeness}. Consider the unparsed
pattern \texttt{\%x = \%y - \%z - \%t} and the same parse tree in
Figure~\ref{fig:src_tree}. The execution trace is
\textsf{UNPAR}\(_2\), \textsf{BIND}\(_1\), \textsf{UNPAR}\(_2\),
\textsf{BIND}\(_1\) and then failure, that is, no rule apply. But
there exists a successful closed\hyp{}tree inclusion if the
substitution \(\{\textsf{x} \mapsto \text{var}(\texttt{a}), \textsf{y}
\mapsto \text{var}(\texttt{a}), \textsf{z} \mapsto
\text{mul}(\text{var}(\texttt{b}), \texttt{*},
\text{var}(\texttt{c})), \textsf{t} \mapsto \text{var}(\texttt{d})\}\)
is applied to the pattern first. Therefore, a match failure with
\textit{ES}(1) can either mean that there is no matching or that one
exists but was not found. In the latter case, meta\-parentheses must
be added to the pattern in order to force an unparsing step instead of
a binding. In the previous example, the successful substitution is
found by \textit{ES}(1) if the unparsed pattern is transformed into
\texttt{\%x = \%(\%(\%y - \%z\%) - \%t\%)}. Of course, as a
worst\hyp{}case, if the pattern is fully meta\-parenthesized
\emph{with respect to the grammar}, \textit{ES}(1) becomes complete in
the sense above, e.g., \texttt{\%(\%x = \%(\%(\%(\%y\%) - \%z\%) -
  \%t\%)\%)}. Indeed, such parenthesising leads to a meta\-parsed
pattern\hyp{}tree which is isomorphic to a tree pattern, as in classic
pattern matching. In other words, there is always a way to
meta\-parenthesize an unparsed pattern to make it as expressive as the
classic, tree\hyp{}based, pattern matching. Moreover, in practice,
only a few meta\-parentheses may be needed for a given pattern, as
shown above.
\begin{figure}[t]
\framebox[\columnwidth]{%
  \includegraphics{const_static}
}%
\caption{A simplified parse tree (no empty words)\label{fig:const_static}}
\end{figure}
By looking closely at the rewrite rule, we can figure out necessary
conditions for an unparsed pattern to lead to a loss of completeness
in matching. These conditions can serve as empirical guidelines to
prevent the problem from appearing. As mentionned above, the problem
occurs when an instance of rule \textsf{BIND}\(_1\) or
\textsf{BIND}\(_2\) is used and later leads to a failure. This failure
could have been avoided, had \textsf{UNPAR}\(_2\) been selected,
perhaps several times, followed by \textsf{BIND}\(_1\) or
\textsf{BIND}\(_2\). Assuming that it is rule \textsf{BIND}\(_1\) that
should be delayed after some \textsf{UNPAR}\(_2\) steps, it means that
the lexeme \(l\) is repeated in the parse forest and occurs each time
after a tree (not a lexeme). Left\hyp{}associative operators in
programming languages usually occur in such kind of grammatical
constructs. This is why the previous pattern had to be written
\texttt{\%x = \%(\%(\%y - \%z\%) - \%t\%)}. Let us consider now that
it is rule \textsf{BIND}\(_2\) that should have been delayed. This
leads unparsed patterns as ``\texttt{\%q \%t \%x ;}'' to fail to match
the parse tree given in Figure~\ref{fig:const_static}. An unparsing
step should be taken instead of a premature binding, so that
\texttt{\%q} matches the type qualifiers and \texttt{\%t} the
type. One way out of this is to use the meta-parenthesized unparsed
pattern \texttt{\%(\%(\%q \%t\%) \%x;\%)} instead. However, a simpler
solution in this case is to use a typed meta\-variable $q$, giving the
pattern `\texttt{\%<quals>q \%t \%x ;}', which does not force the user
to know anything about the nesting structure of the AST, and is also
arguably more readable than the former meta\-parenthesized pattern.

In fact, a typed meta\-variable \texttt{\%<c>x} forces the algorithm
to perform as many unparse step as needed before obtaining a tree of
the form \(c(\ldots)\) at the left of the forest. Hence, the only
possible ambiguity with a typed meta\-variable is when several trees
of the form \(c(\ldots)\) can be obtained by such a continuous
sequence of unparse steps. It is easy to see that this situation
always corresponds to a (directly or indirectly) left\hyp{}recursive
grammar construct such as a left\hyp{}associative operator, a
left\hyp{}recursive list construct, etc. The set of such constructs
may be automatically produced based on the subject language
grammar. For these constructs, the algorithm will bind the
meta\-variable typed with \(c\) to the biggest, enclosing \(c\)
construct. If this is not what is needed, meta\-parentheses must be
added to force more unparse steps.

Summarising: parsing failures can always be solved by typing the
conflicting meta\-variable, except when that variable must bind a
\emph{nested} left\hyp{}recursive construct, in which case the pattern
needs to be meta\-parenthesized. Of course, meta\-parentheses and
typed variables can be freely combined and may complement each other.
