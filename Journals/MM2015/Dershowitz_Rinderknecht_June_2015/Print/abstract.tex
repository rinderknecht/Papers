\paragraph{Summary}

The average height of Catalan trees of a given size is a structural
parameter important in the analysis of algorithms, as it measures the
expected maximum cost of a search in a tree. This parameter has been
studied first with generating functions and complex variable theory,
yielding an asymptotic approximation. Later on, real analysis was used
instead of complex analysis. We have further reduced the conceptual
difficulty by replacing generating functions with the enumeration of
monotonic lattice paths, whose graphical representations make the
derivation much more intuitive.
