Let \(\Expected{E_n}\)~be the \emph{average external path length} of a
Catalan tree with~\(n\) edges, that is, the average level of a
leaf. We have
\begin{align*}
\Expected{E_n} \cdot C_n
  &:= \sum_{l=0}^{n} l \cdot \mathcal{N}_n(l,0)
   = \sum_{l=0}^{n}l\left[\binom{2n-1}{n+l-1} -
     \binom{2n-1}{n+l}\right]\\
  &= \sum_{l=0}^{n-1}(l+1)\binom{2n-1}{n+l} -
     \sum_{l=0}^{n-1}l \binom{2n-1}{n+l}
   = \sum_{l=0}^{n-1}\binom{2n-1}{n+l},\\
\Expected{E_n} \cdot C_n
  &= \sum_{i=n}^{2n-1}\binom{2n-1}{i}
   = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=0}^{2n-1}\binom{2n-1}{j} = 4^{n-1},
\end{align*}
where the penultimate step follows from the fact that an odd row in
Pascal's triangle contains an even number of coefficients and the two
halves have equal sums. We conclude:
\begin{equation}
\Expected{E_n} = (n+1) 4^{n-1}\binom{2n}{n}^{-1} \sim
\frac{1}{4}n\sqrt{\pi n}.
\label{eq:EEn}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Leaves}

If we look back at the Dyck paths in \fig~\ref{fig:dyck} and
\fig~\ref{fig:dyck_deg}, we recall that they are in bijection, the
latter expressing the former with the degrees of the nodes. We also
know that Dyck paths are in bijection with Catalan trees. The key is
that the leaves in the tree equivalent to the path in
\fig~\ref{fig:dyck} correspond to the corners, whereas the inner nodes
of the tree equivalent to the path in \fig~\ref{fig:dyck_deg}
correspond to the corners. This simple observation entails that there
are as many leaves as there are inner nodes in the set of all Catalan
trees of a given size. If that size is \(n\)~edges, then the number
leaves plus the number of inner nodes is~\(n+1\), hence the average
number of leaves \(\Expected{L_n}\) is \((n+1)/2\). Moreover,
\(\Expected{E_n}/\Expected{L_n}\) is the average level of a
leaf. Using equation~\eqref{eq:EEn}, we draw:
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\Expected{E_n}}{\Expected{L_n}} =
\frac{1}{2}4^n\binom{2n}{n}^{-1} \sim \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\pi n}.
\end{equation*}
