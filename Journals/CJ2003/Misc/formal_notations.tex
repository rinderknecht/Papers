We denote \emph{type references} by $x$, and \emph{value references}
by $y$.
%%, sets of type references by ${\cal A}$, sets of value
%%references by ${\cal B}$.

A \emph{type} is noted \T, a
\emph{value} is noted $v$, a \emph{constraint} is noted ${\cal C}$. A
\emph{subtype} is denoted by $s$.

A \emph{type binding} is a couple made of a type reference $x$ and a
subtype $s$; we note them $x \mapsto s$, or $\gamma$.

A \emph{value binding} is a couple made of a value reference $y$ and a
couple made of a value $v$ and a subtype $s$; we note them $y \mapsto
(v, s)$, or $\delta$.

A \emph{type environment} is a couple made of a set of type references
${\cal A}$ and a function $\Gamma$ from type references $x$ to
subtypes $s$; we note them $\TypeEnv$.

A \emph{value environment} is a couple made of a set of value
references ${\cal B}$ and a function $\Delta$ from value references
$y$ to pairs $(v,s)$; we note them $\ValueEnv$.

We note $\oplus$ the function extending the type and value environment
with a new binding; we use it in infix position like in: $\TypeEnv
\oplus x \mapsto s$

Labels are noted $l$, and a list of labels $\Lambda$.
