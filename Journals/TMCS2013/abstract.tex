  Due to technical difficulties, educators teaching merge sort often
  avoid the analysis of the cost in the general and average
  cases. Using basic discrete mathematics, elementary real analysis
  and mathematical induction, we propose a self\hyp{}contained
  derivation of bounds $\alpha n\log_2 n + \beta n + \gamma$ in all
  cases. Independent of any programming language or pseudo\hyp{}code,
  supported by intuitive figures, it is suitable for informatics
  students interested in the analysis of algorithms. It is also a good
  exercise in showing that induction allows us to actually discover
  constants, instead of simply checking them a posteriori.
