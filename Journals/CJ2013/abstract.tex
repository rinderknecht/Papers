  Using only calculus, discrete mathematics and mathematical
  induction, we derive tight bounds of the form \(\alpha n\lg n +
  \beta n + \gamma\), where~\(\alpha\), \(\beta\)~and~\(\gamma\) are
  constants, on the cost of bottom-up merge sort, in its best, worst
  and average cases. By contrast, exact closed forms for the linear
  terms require Fourier and complex analysis, which make them
  unsuitable to most computer scientists, in particular postgraduate
  students who program the algorithm. Furthermore, we precisely
  compare the cost of bottom-up merge sort with its top-down variant,
  by means of induction only. Whilst these results are already known,
  we expect our method to be more didactic.
